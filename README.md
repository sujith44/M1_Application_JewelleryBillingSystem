## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1.GCC erorr in windows and linux: installed the gcc msys64 mingw64 properly.

2.Generation of makefile: To overcome this problem research on makefiles was done.

3.Unity testing: Initially a few testcases did not pass, to overcome this issue debugging of program was performed.
